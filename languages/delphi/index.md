These standards apply to all Delphi code. They focus on modern Object Pascal practices, memory management, and clean architecture.

#### Contents

* [Design Principles](./design.md): Interfaces, dependency injection, and modern language features.
* [Formatting & Style](./formatting.md): PascalCase, indentation, and code organization.
* [Naming Conventions](./naming.md): `T` prefix, argument naming, and removing Hungarian notation.

## Quick Start

Ensure your IDE is configured with the standard formatter compliance settings (see `DelphiFormatter.config`).
